            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Recent advances in quantum caffeination theory have revealed
                unexpected correlations between entangled coffee molecules and
                workplace productivity metrics. This study demonstrates that QEC
                particles exhibit non-local effects on human consciousness, resulting
                in a <b>47.3% improvement</b> in task completion rates. Using a
                double-blind, placebo-controlled methodology with n = 2,847
                participants, we observed statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001)
                enhancements in cognitive function following consumption of
                quantum-entangled espresso. These findings suggest potential
                applications in corporate efficiency optimization and may explain the
                universe's apparent preference for morning meetings.

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The relationship between caffeine consumption and productivity has
                been documented since the discovery of coffee in 850 CE [1]. However,
                traditional models fail to explain the <i>Afternoon Paradox</i> — the
                phenomenon whereby productivity decreases inversely with coffee
                consumption after 2:00 PM local time.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Coffee is a beverage that puts one to sleep when not drank."
                <br /><br />
                <cite>&#8212;Alphonse Allais, 1893</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Recent work by Johnson et al. [2] proposed that coffee molecules might
                exist in quantum superposition states. Building on this foundation, we
                hypothesized that entangled coffee particles could maintain coherence
                across spatial and temporal boundaries, potentially solving the
                Afternoon Paradox.

            <h3>2.1 Quantum Coffee Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                The experimental setup was revised to enhance clarity and safety
                protocols. The original method:
            </p>
            <p>
                <s>Grinding beans manually in the presence of a magnetic field. </s>
            </p>
            <p>was updated to:</p>
            <p>
                <u>Automated grinding under cryogenic stabilization to preserve
                    entanglement integrity.</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                Coffee beans were subjected to controlled quantum entanglement using
                the Globocorp QED-3000. The process involved:

                <li>Brewing under 1.21 gigapascals of pressure</li>
                <li>
                    Immediate consumption within the decoherence window (τ &lt; 5
