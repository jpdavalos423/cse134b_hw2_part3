        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Recent advances in quantum caffeination theory have revealed
          unexpected correlations between entangled coffee molecules and
          workplace productivity metrics. This study demonstrates that QEC
          particles exhibit non-local effects on human consciousness, resulting
          in a <b>47.3% improvement</b> in task completion rates. Using a
          double-blind, placebo-controlled methodology with n = 2,847
          participants, we observed statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001)
          enhancements in cognitive function following consumption of
          quantum-entangled espresso. These findings suggest potential
          applications in corporate efficiency optimization and may explain the
          universe's apparent preference for morning meetings.

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The relationship between caffeine consumption and productivity has
          been documented since the discovery of coffee in 850 CE [1]. However,
          traditional models fail to explain the <i>Afternoon Paradox</i> â€” the
          phenomenon whereby productivity decreases inversely with coffee
          consumption after 2:00 PM local time.

          "Coffee is a beverage that puts one to sleep when not drank." <br><br />

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Recent work by Johnson et al. [2] proposed that coffee molecules might
          exist in quantum superposition states. Building on this foundation, we
          hypothesized that entangled coffee particles could maintain coherence
          across spatial and temporal boundaries, potentially solving the
          Afternoon Paradox.
